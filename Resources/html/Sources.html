                      <h6>Dates & Hospital Tables</h6>
                      <p>Data for the policy enforcement dates (mass gathering restrictions, initial business closure, 
                        education facilities closure, nonessential services closure, stay at home order, travel severely limited) 
                        and hospital resources (beds needed, available, and shortage; icu beds needed, available, and shortage; 
                        and ventilators needed) were scraped from the IHME COVID-19 website for the dates and hospital tables, respectively. 
                        Data for each state can be accessed by adding a backslash and the name of the state (or District of Columbia) 
                        at the end of the URL, using only lowercase letters and using a dash instead of spaces 
                        (ex: https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/new-york). The information for when policy dates 
                        were instituted and hospital resources are in separate parts of each individual state page but in the same location 
                        on the page across all states, so the code for scraping remains the same for each state. The data did not need to be 
                        cleaned as we only pulled the information we wanted to have in the database from this site. However, the following 
                        information was updated:</p>
                        <p>•	The dates were in string and are converted to date-time objects</p>
                        <p>•	The hospital resource numbers were also in strings. The numeric part of the string was pulled and converted to integer</p>

                    <p>A CSV file with the count of confirmed cases and deaths reported in the US by county and state was downloaded from Kaggle (Navigate to 'Data' section and download usa_county_wise.csv). 
                      This website compiled their data using the Github repository from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this data is to have a view of the magnitude of COVID-19 cases and deaths at a county level. For this reason, data clean-up included:</p>
                      <p>•	Removing rows for US territories and only keeping data pertaining to states</p>
                      <p>•	Removing columns that provided duplicate country-based information (UID, iso2, iso3, and code3)</p>
                      <p>•	Renaming columns for clarity (Admin 2 to County, Province_State to State, Long_ to Lng)</p>
                      <p>•	Dropped rows with missing values and reset the index to be used as a primary key</p>
                      <p>•	Changing the date values from strings to datetime objects so comparisons and filtering can be done on the final data table</p>
                      <p>•	Cleaned data were exported as a CSV file and loaded into the <strong>Counties Table</strong>.</p>

                      District of Columbia. This information is provided and updated on a minute basis. No data needed to be cleaned as it was 
                      already in a presentable format when scraped. However, the following information was omitted because it was outside 
                      the scope of our focus:</p>

                      <p>Forecast data for the range of potential deaths from COVID-19 is available from the CDC at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html. 
                        This data is provided by state and shows predictions from different models for 1 to 4 weeks in the future.</p>
                      <p>Forecasts fall into one of three categories:
                        <p>•	The LANL model does not explicitly model the effects of individual social distancing measures but assumes 
                          that implemented interventions will continue to be upheld in the future resulting in decreased growth.</p>
                        <p>•	The IHME, MOBS_NEU, UT Austin and YYG models are conditional on existing social distancing measures continuing through 
                          the projected time−period.</p>
                        <p>•	The CU models make different assumptions about the effectiveness of current social distancing interventions.</p>  
                      <p>The forecast data was downloaded as a CSV file. The purpose of this dataset was for forecast data by state, date, and type of model. Data clean-up included:</p>
                        <p>•	Removing rows that aggregated data for the US as a whole</p>
                        <p>•	Removing rows with missing information</p>
                        <p>•	Renaming columns for clarity (target week end date to target end date, location name to state, point to actual)</p>
                        <p>•	Changing the date values from strings to datetime objects so comparisons and filtering can be done on the final data table</p>
